# Gradient Boosting Masterclass — From Functional Gradients to Production Diagnostics

This package is the canonical Gradient Boosting learning path in `PGA43_ML`. It mirrors the repository's linear, logistic, decision-tree, and random-forest masterclasses: one executed notebook is the primary source of understanding, deterministic dataset contracts are recorded locally, and a rendered HTML companion is included.

## What the notebook teaches

- supervised-learning placement: additive ensembles, bagging versus boosting, and weak learners;
- functional gradient descent and stage-wise additive modeling;
- squared-error derivation where the negative gradient is the residual;
- binary log-loss derivation where the pseudo-residual is `y - p`;
- manual stage calculations and prediction decomposition;
- from-scratch regression and binary-classification implementations;
- scikit-learn `GradientBoostingRegressor` and `GradientBoostingClassifier`;
- leakage-safe train/validation/test protocol;
- learning-rate/estimator trade-offs, depth, leaf size, subsampling, and early stopping;
- regression residual diagnostics, classification discrimination, calibration, threshold policy, and decision cost;
- permutation importance, partial dependence, model limitations, drift, monitoring, and deployment gates.

## Reproduce

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate pga43-gradient-boosting
jupyter lab
```

Open `notebooks/gradient_boosting_masterclass.ipynb` and run all cells from the package root. The committed notebook is already executed and contains all outputs.

Validate the package:

```bash
python scripts/verify_package.py
```

## Dataset policy

The notebook loads deterministic copies of scikit-learn's bundled diabetes regression and breast-cancer classification datasets. `data/dataset_manifest.json` records the loaders, shapes, targets, and expected CSV hashes. They are used strictly for education and benchmarking, not clinical decision-making.
